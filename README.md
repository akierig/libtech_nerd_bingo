# Library Tech Nerd Bingo

Nerd Bingo is a bingo card that came about when, during a discussion about `git`. I (@akierig) mentioned that I use `git` to sync my `.bash_profile` and other personal preferences (e.g., IRC client configuration) across the five computers in my life. 

In response, one of my distinguished fellow conferees said "And I think that's nerd bingo right there!"

Nerd Bingo was born.

## Provenance, etc.
It wouldn't be _truly_ library nerdy if I failed to note the following.
